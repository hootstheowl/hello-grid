*Hello, Grid!* is a minimalist, flexbox-based, grid system created to simplify the process of programming complex (and not so complex) layouts for modern web-applications using JSX.

Out of the box, *Hello, Grid!* contains **no initial styling, themes, or colors**. It's primary purpose is layout architecture and content arrangement, relying on your application to style your blueprint however you see fit.
